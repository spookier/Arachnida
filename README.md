# Arachnida

#### **Arachnida consists of two cybersecurity projects focusing on data scraping and metadata manipulation**

### - [Spider](https://github.com/spookier/Arachnida/tree/main/Spider)
- Spider is a web scraping tool specifically designed to extract images from a website.
- Given a URL, it recursively scans the site and downloads any image it finds.
- The depth of the recursive scan and the download location can be specified through command-line options.

### - [Scorpion](https://github.com/spookier/Arachnida/tree/main/Scorpion)
- Scorpion is a metadata analysis tool for image files.
- It parses image files for EXIF and other metadata, displaying them on the screen.
- It is compatible with the same extensions that Spider handles and displays basic attributes such as creation date, as well as EXIF data.
